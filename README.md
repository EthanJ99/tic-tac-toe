## Introduction
This is a tic-tac-toe game playable in a web browser. It is based on the official [React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe), however it has been migrated from a `create-react-app` JavaScript template to a `Next.js` TypeScript project (with additional code cleanup and type checks).

## Running
To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
